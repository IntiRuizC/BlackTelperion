# BlackTelperion

BlackTelperion is Black Square's specialized proprietary library for the processing and analysis of hyperspectral and multispectral imagery across multiple platforms. Named after Telperion, the silver tree that illuminated the world with its radiant light in Tolkien's legendarium, our library transforms spectral information into clear, meaningful data. Designed for remote sensing applications, BlackTelperion offers robust capabilities for capturing, processing, and interpreting spectral data from various platforms.

## Purpose

BlackTelperion serves as a unified framework for processing spectral imagery from various sources:
- Sentinel-2 (ESA)
- ASTER (NASA/METI)
- ENMAP (DLR)
- Hyspex (Our hyperspectral camera)
- Additional platforms (planned for future integration)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- GDAL/OGR
- NumPy
- Xarray
- Rasterio
- Scikit-learn
- PyTorch (for deep learning components)

### Installation

For team members:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:blacksquare/BlackTelperion.git

# Install in development mode
cd BlackTelperion
pip install -e .
```

## Documentation

Internal documentation and examples can be found in the project wiki.

## Basic Usage

```python

#To be defined

```

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Processing Modules

1. Create a new class in the appropriate platform-specific directory
2. Inherit from `BaseProcessingBox`
3. Implement the required methods
4. Add unit tests

### Creating New Pipelines

Pipelines combine multiple processing boxes to create end-to-end workflows. See `base_pipeline.py` for the interface definition.

## Contributing

All team members are encouraged to contribute. Please follow these steps:

1. Create a feature branch from `develop`
2. Implement your changes with appropriate tests
3. Submit a pull request
4. Request review from a team member
